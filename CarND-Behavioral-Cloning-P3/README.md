# **Behavioral Cloning**

**The goal of this project is to design and train CNN to perform autonomous driving in a simulator**

---

### 1. Project files

The project includes the following files:

* `model.py` contains the script to create and train CNN
* `model.h5` contains a trained CNN
* `drive.py` for driving the car in autonomous mode using simulator
* `video.mp4` is a video of autonomous driving with a trained CNN

The `model.py` contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The trained CNN is saved in `model.h5`.

Using Udacity simulator, the car can be driven autonomously around the track with a help of trained CNN by executing:
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

Video example of autonomous driving is provided by `video.mp4`.

### 2. Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### Model Architecture

The initial network architecture was similar to LeNet-5. Different shapes of layers were evaluated and different data collection strategies were tried, but it was not possible to obtain a trained CNN which could perform successfully in the simulator, i.e. vehicle didn't stay on track.

After some investigation, the network proposed by Nvidia ([arXiv:1604.07316v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07316v1)) was implemented. The network consists of 5 convolution and 5 activation layers, followed by 3 fully connected layers. In addition, two dropout layers were added to help with possible overfitting problems. The network also contains 3 layers to crop, resize and normalize the data. This network was successfully trained and run in the simulator.

#### Data Collection Strategy

Data collection was performed by carefully driving around the track one lap forward and then one lap backward. After some experiments, it was found that 5 such steps are required (i.e. 5 laps forward and 5 laps backward). Only center camera images were used. Some examples of such images:

<img src="./images/center_2018_07_07_13_55_57_508.jpg">

The total amount of images was 42162. The data was shuffled and splitted (80% for training, 20% for validation).

Due to substantial amount of data, generators for training and validation data sets were constructed and used.

#### Model Training

Adam optimizer is used, so the learning rate was not tuned manually.

Model was trained for 3 epochs. Here are training and validation losses:

The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track. The recorded video is provided in `video.mp4`.
